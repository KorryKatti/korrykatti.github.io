                i dunno how to start this so let me start with my first tweet i posted this year that is
            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
                <p lang="en" dir="ltr">didn&#39;t achieve much this year but atleast it was better than 2023. Started

                    before i turn 20 ( will turn this year )<br><br>well only time will tell but it feels like this will

                2025 will be my year was my claim at the start of the year because it felt different and for the first
                few months it did work out like that , now i wont be going into much details but i was making progress ,
                which again can't be considered great but it was better than a past few years so i guess that counts.
                for the first 5-6 months i also posted regular biweekly updates ( or weekly i don't really remember ) on
                my twitter but then stopped after i entered a new semester . a part of it was the reception ofc but it
                also felt like i was really faking it since i posted it for the purpose of posting it , even if the work
                i did was significant or not i just posted it , delivering me a fake copeium that i was doing something
                productive. also i was greatly influenced by the ongoing trends on the interenet that instead of
                focusing most on my own work i started pivoting towards all that , which is ofc good , since knowledge
                never goes to waste , but was never relevant to me or my actual goals. so in around july i stopped
                posting and started using twitter sparingly , but i was still very online on it , i was just
                doomscrolling on it though.

            <p>
                starting august i decided to spend more time playing , offline that is. it did work dare i say since i
                played football for like 1.5 months everyday for around 1 hour , it was fun and after that i was too
                exhausted to do any work so while it did help me take a break from the internet and all that work i
                realized i was not progressing. now i guess i was progressing in a way that i was more outside and less
                online , full day college and in the evening football -> then college work and sleep and the cycle
                repeats. but i wanted to make something still and it really itched me how little time i was getting, but
                i knew denying going to football was going to make me lose the friends i had made , which is hard for me
                anyways , so i continued for the time specified , around till october after which i stoppped going
                altogether and it was the whole previous thing again , insane screen times and all that. see while
                writing this i do realize i was just living on the extremes of both sides , first being too much outside
                and less work and then too much work and less outside time. this was bad since balance was necessary but
                i was not able to find it.

            <p>
                right now as i am writing this i am listening to a video on irc by <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UbKenFipjo&list=WL&index=45" target="_blank">the serial
                    port</a> . now i didn't grow up on irc , i grew up on skype and discord and all that but i did make
                an irc acccount earlier this year and in november and decemeber i spent a not so much amount of time but
                a good amount of time on irc since i found someone to talk to in a channel , we didnt talk regularly ofc
                as we had our schedules and all that but it was fun. i assume it was an older person to me as he kept
                giving me advices like instructions on enjoying college life and all that , which i barely took
                seriously ( even though i knew he was right in a sense ) but yeah. continuing on this months i focused
                more on college studies till novemeber ended and gave my ends sems after that. then came december and i
                am talking past 19th december here , the weather is a bit chilly , at the time of writing htis its 18
                degrees celcius and many people went home for vacations but many stayed back. i stayed back too ,
                thinking yeah being alone would make me do something or yk just change something in me so i became less
                of a doomscroller , i don't know why i did that or thought so but yeah it was a 50-50 decision i would
                say , it wasn't bad and it wasn't good. i tried drawing and succeeded at it , cuz well i used to <a
                    href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/rs1sot/i_tried_drawing_after_4_years/"
                    target="_blank">do it earlier too </a>so wasn't much of an effort just needed the wish to start , yk
                the wish to start is the most critical thing that is needed , also made some music using strudel which i
                am not proud of and won't be showing , but you get what i am getting at here , i was trying to make a
                game , with 2 other people i met online. i think we might continue on that in 2026 but idk.
            </p>

                alt="its getting repetitive now isn't it and almost predictable that an image will come after a long text ?">
            <p>
                now that was a month by month report kinda thing yk , now i will just yap in general.
                the images i am putting in between the paragraphs are just random images that are coming on my feed ,
                idk why i am explaining this but regardless i decided to let you know.
                hmm..
            <p hidden>even though i am theming my site to be a bit more frutiger aero , it is because i did grow up on
                windows 7 till 2021</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                ykw i don't really know what to type now but i know if i stop and publish here , ideas will keep coming
                to me and i will keep editing so i think i will really take my time with this. content here is not in
                monthly or in any order , i just put it as i seem to remembering it
            </p>
            <p>i did get 100+ followers on twitter at a time around august or september i guess but then i blocked out
                all the bots and it decreased the number , not that i am concerned but just a casual observation. also
                my feed has been filled with some really awesome people , most of them are tech bros if i say so but
                yeah its fun reading their thoughts and also putting out mine thoughts. it was fun and i will be doing
                it in the coming years too. that reminds me , around in septemeber i was finally convinced by a friend
                in college to make an instagram account and that i did , though from since then i have alternated
                between disabling it and deleting it but the meta 30 day policy really brings me back to it. i think i
                will finally get rid of it in the new year , since its trash , all the stuff there is repetitive ,
                nothing new or original , well there are many editors and all that but since there is so much of the
                same stuff, yk brainrot , its feels like forcing myself to enjoy it. true knowing ball ( context ) about
                various stuff is cool but i do realise its not good for my brain in the long term. also got rid of my
                discord account since i was too addicted to it too. well i certainly will make a new one but i will try
                to keep it in control. its funny how screen is the only addiciton i have gotten in my entire life ,
                nothing else has had such an effect on me. well in my defense they do spend millions if not billions to
                master this algorithm, who am i to escape it.</p>

                alt="yhet another image , yk the point til now">
            <p>
                i also learnt some new things this year , mostly code related , like react and cpp ( well i knew C from
                very long ago but never really used it ). oh that reminds me of the game i was making in cpp , its still
                in progress though it does look like its halted lmao but i will continue on it in 2026. also <a
                    href="https://codeforces-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/card?username=korrykatti&theme=codeSTACKr&disable_animations=false&show_icons=true&force_username=false"
                    target="_blank">some codeforces</a> this year , though couldn't do leetcode , was too yk structured
                for me. was rewally into codeforces in the middle of the year , watching content more than solving it
                this year lmao , but i do hope to continue that in the new year but making no promises as of yet. also
                near end of december did a decent sized project for my resume , idk how that will work about but was
                exhusting ngl. if it feels like i am trying to be some sort of a tech bro or yk know it all , then yeah
                i guess i am trying to be one , but its not like i am faking it or yk just trying to show off , i
                genuinely like this stuff and want to do something in this field so yea. idk why i wrote that sounded
                like copeium but whatever.
            </p>
            <p>
                also i made like +5 friends this year in college than last year , so thats a gain which i am kinda happy
                about , dunno how long will it last or will it even exist after i leave college but yeah for now its
                fun. also made 2-3 friends online ( this is actually a new low for me lmao as this is the first year i
                made such less online friends , friends in the sense talk to very often ) but yeah it is what it is. one
                of my main goals in 2026 is to make more friends online and offline both tbh , but will see how that
                works out
            </p>
            <p>
                atmost 10 people will read this anyways so idk , i will try writing more often in the new year. at the
                start of this year my time was combined in some counter strike and war thunder but since counter strike
                now doesnt allow playing on cloudflare warp , i stopped playing it and i guess it shows that well on my
                steam replay for this year. also got into a lot of yk building or whatever games like city skyline and
                openttd and bar ( beyond all reason ). its funny how earlier i said i can't seem to be addicted to
                anything else and yet here i am , i was very addicted to openttd when i finally understood how to play
                it. now on a friends suggestions i have got myself frostpunk and on my own will , skyrim. oblivion was
                great ngl and i think skyrim will be too. also did a good bit of sim racing , well mostly with my
                keyboard this year but it was fun. i think i will build a steering wheel with arduino and all that in
                the new year if time permits. also played dark souls 1 this year and god it was so much fun. didn't
                touch any other souls game after that but that is a different story.also got into visual novels this
                year , STEINS; GATE 0 , for the most time but some others as well. right now i crave for some
                multiplayer games with voice chats but idk which one to play , the finals and apex are too fast , cs2
                doesnt work on my network and war thunder i have played a lot so i don't really wish to continue it in
                the new year. i have unlocked some starter jets and i guess that is a good achievement for me this year.
                also played detroit become human and it was fun. its funny lmao how the copilot in the ide keeps
                suggesting me to write more games and i never follow it lol. its now suggesting me to write a game in
                rust. idek rust. anyways. i think thats like the good cover of gaming this year.
            </p>

                alt="why do i have to keep the attention of someone ? its not like many people will even make it till here"
                <p>
            i also watched a bit of movies and shows and animes and all that this year , instead of taking up a lot of
            space for it i will just drop the links to the lists , for shows though , i watched The Mentalist and only
            season 1 , can't make myself to stay commited and its not due to show being bad , its the same with every
            show.

            <ul>
                <li>movies list : <a href="https://letterboxd.com/korrykatti/" target="_blank">here</a></li>
                <li>anime list : <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/korrykatti" target="_blank">here</a></li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p> i think the biggest thing i am taking away from this year is that i am done swinging between extremes
                and then acting surprised when i burn out. being completely offline didn’t magically make me create
                things, and being constantly online didn’t magically make me disciplined. both just gave me different
                ways to avoid sitting with the discomfort of slow, boring progress. </p>
            <p> i also realized that narrating my life in real time doesn’t work for me. posting updates, even honest
                ones, turns into performance very quickly, and i start optimizing for the feeling of “having done
                something” instead of actually doing it. so in 2026, if i make something, it will exist first. whether
                it gets shared or not will be a secondary decision. </p>
            <p> i don’t think balance is something i can plan in advance. it’s something i notice only after i lose it.
                so instead of aiming for balance, i want to aim for continuity , doing small things consistently without
                trying to turn every phase of my life into a statement or an era. </p>
            <p> i’m ending this year without a big win, without a clean arc, and without a dramatic transformation. but
                i do feel slightly more aware of my own patterns, and for now that’s enough. if 2025 was about trying
                things and oscillating wildly, then maybe 2026 can just be about staying. </p>
            <p>
                now i won't say my year was bad , heck it was the best year in the last 4 years if i am being honest. so
                for my next year my main goal will be making more friends or just talking more in general , social
                skills yk since i fear the lack of it may cause hurdles and also visiting more places . well i am not
                promising anything since that won't work , i know that by now. idk if i will change , but i will try.
            </p>
            <p>2030 is so close man , when i was a kid i never even imagined these days , like i never imagined living
                through these days. its funny almost , i don't miss my childhood much but i do miss the feels of it i
                guess. ofc i am more knowledgable now but i think its with a lot of stress , even if i don't admit it.
                but still its crazy man how close 2030 is , its almost scary. time will pass , that i know. what i don't
                know is what i will do or what i should do , but i hope i find it out.</p>

            <p> i’ll stop here. </p>
