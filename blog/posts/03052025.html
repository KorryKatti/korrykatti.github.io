            <h2>watching too much steins;gate, hear me out</h2>
            <p>peak show , you must watch fr. getting to the point now , astronauts who spend too much time in space
                move forward in time , even if by a little amount of time , or that is what is claimed <a
                    href="https://www.wired.com/2014/11/time-dilation/">here. also this whole idea just came to me in a
                    random spur of moment so if it sounds wrong it probably is. i will try to fact check most of the
                    things but i intend for a good enough content to be raw</a></p>
            <p> also this thing will only go in the future </p>
            <p>
                midway writing this i have realized that that this is entirely useless , there is no use for sending a
                message into the future because we won't know of its occurence till we reach that future too , and that
                beats the entire pupose of what i am aboiut to write; but i still will write because i can and i wish
                to.
            </p>

            <p>if you are still with me till here then i thank you, please do read ahead </p>
            <h2>the donut idea</h2>
            <p>so the core thought was this - what if i make a donut shaped tube, like a torus, and trap light inside
                it. we shoot a lifi signal (aka high-speed blinking light carrying data) into this loop and just keep it
                spinning. why? because light's fast af and if we keep it moving in this closed path, maybe we can mess
                with time, or at least *pretend* we can.</p>

            <p>obviously, light's already traveling at max speed (c, the cosmic speed limit), but maybe there's a way to
                delay when it exits. imagine you're trying to tell future-you something, and instead of sending the
                message now, you *load* it into this loop and let it chill there until some condition is met, like time
                passing, or a trigger switch activating a mirror to reflect it out. kind of like sending yourself a
                delayed text, but with physics cosplay.</p>

            <h2>is it dumb? yes. am i writing it anyway? also yes.</h2>
            <p>realistically, this falls apart under energy constraints, field stability, and literally every law of
                thermodynamics. but the point isn't building a time machine - it's asking: what if we could? what if
                this donut-loop could store a message not in space, but in time?</p>

            <p>also i refuse to believe people built pyramids and i can't build a photon racetrack in a torus tube with
                makeshift capacitors and a dream.</p>
