            <h2>my mouse stopped working</h2>
            <p>so my mouse which i had been using since 5 years decided to stop functioning and i tried repairing it
                [its dead now and i have ordered a new one]</p>
            <p>so first of all as anyone would do i tried moving its wire to confirm its not a loose wire , well i guess
                this is what the actual problem was
            <p>
                the rgb of the mouse and optical led kept blinking and windows keep playing the disconenct and connect
                sounds , so i then tried to connect it to different devices to confirm if my port was the issue , well
                it was not and the mouse was the problem
            </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                so i decided then to open the mouse , my hope being the wire was loose in the mouse and not in the
                actual cable , well i was wrong , the wires in the mouse were just fine , then this means the cable is
                at fault , and finding where the issue is in a 1m long cable is useless work or say painful work ( i am
                still reaching out to my mouse and realising its not here anymore lol )
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                so what would a normal person do at this point ? well someone in engineering would probably take out the
                rgb lights for future fun things , well i am an engineer too and i will be doing that , but what more
                than that ?
            </p>
            <p>well chatgpt says this is what a normal person would do:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"A normal person, upon realizing their mouse is dead, would first try basic troubleshooting—wiggling
                    the wire, switching USB ports, and testing it on another device. If that fails, they'd accept defeat
                    and either buy a new one immediately or temporarily suffer using a trackpad. Some might toss the
                    broken mouse in a drawer, thinking they’ll fix it 'someday,' while others would just throw it away
                    and move on."</p>
            </blockquote>
            yeah i guess that is what a normal person would do , i mean even i have tossed it into the drawer rn but
            here is what i did before , dunno why am i sharing this but its my blog so i can say whatever i wanna say
            </p>
            <p>
                i downloaded a compass app . why you may ask , cuz electricity creates magnetic field right ? so what my
                thought process behind this was i could move the mobile over the wire and wherever the magnetic field
                dropped i could cut wire there and remove that part of wire and join the remaining free ends ; stupid i
                know but hey i did some thinking
            </p>
            <p>
                turns out the app ( the compass app ) was shit , and i mean it , it was a internet and gps based compass
                and i wanted a magnetic field detecting compass. so what did i do next ? well i had connected the wire
                and layed out on the table along its length so i might as well do some more work on it. but for that i
                needed a magnetic field detector and that is not easy to find
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                i rememberd something i used to use to make some things in the past , and i opened it
            </p>
            <p>
                i opened mit app inventor ; created a new project and made a magnetic field sensor android app which
                shows magnetic field strength in numeric values and compiled it into a apk . now i had a app which could
                tell me strength of magnetic field at any point
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/r919b9.png" alt="peak app design btw">
            </p>
            <p>
                so what this app does is show magnetic fields as i move the mobile ; it did work as when i passed it
                over laptop it reached 50 and over human body it was 37 so i guess it worked ?? well whatever so i
                started hovering it over wire while it was connected
            </p>
            <p>
                at a certain point it showed lower than the average value that was showing over the whole wire so i
                decided this must be the point and well i didn't have proper wire cutter so i used a cutter and started
                trimming wire from its circumference slowly and slowly till i got to the bottom wire and man it was
                stuck , stuck in the sense those 4 wires inside the wire were stuck like brothers
            </p>
            <p>
                at this point i decided it was not worth it and just kept the mouse in the drawer and ordere a new one
                over amazon ; a wired one ofc cuz i like wired ones more than wireless ones , well now i gotta wait for
                it to arrive
            </p>
            <p>
                now that i look at it taking a common person approach and my approach both ended in the same result , a
                new mouse and old one in drawer , that means i am a peak time waste and i should probably stop doing
                this and start doing something productive
            </p>

                thanks for reading ( i think i will add a mailing list and comment section on this in the future till
                then have a good day )
