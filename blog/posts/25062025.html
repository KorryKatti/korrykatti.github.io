            <p>consider this a devlog where i post my progress and what i have learnt while making this</p>
            <p> the main goal is to learn cpp , and well i tried many things to do so but decided to learn the core of
                cpp this would be the best way to</p>
            <h2>introduction</h2>
            <p>so i like to play map games , sitting in front of the screen for hours looking at my nations progress and
                get attacked, but you know all of them have a big learning curve , like a big tutorial you have to go
                through before you even understand what to do</p>
            <p>so i decided to make a similar game , tho with no graphics ( as of yet ) using cpp to play strategy games
                without getting paywalled to rise my level</p>
            <p>that was the primary inspiration for making this , combined with the fact that i wanted to learn c++ at a
                good level</p>
            <p> so below is the devlog ( as they call it) , i will include some images too i guess but no videos ( as of
                writing this ) </p>
            <h2>progress</h2>
            <h3>June 25 2025 ; what has happened till now</h3>
            <p>code uptil now is <a
                    href="https://github.com/KorryKatti/strat_game/commit/e03cd9ac8f48c5d7f01bf7240bf383bbe59e9c4e"
                    target="_blank">available here</a></p>
            <p>
            <p> i will start explaining the flow from the main funciton</p>
            <p>
                so first, i define two integers: <code>rows</code> and <code>cols</code>.
                then i take input from the user to let them pick a custom size—like 40 x 40.
                after that, i call <code>makeRegion(rows, cols)</code> and use <code>auto</code> to store the result.
            </p>

            <p>
                <code>makeRegion</code> returns a pair—first is a 2D vector (our grid), second is a map of
                <code>int → string</code> for region names.
                inside <code>makeRegion</code>, we call <code>createGrid(rows, cols)</code> which just builds the 2D
                vector.
                the result is stored back using <code>auto grid</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                then, i prep a map named <code>regionNames</code> that links region ids to names—stuff like
                <code>{1: "coastline"}</code>, <code>{2: "midlands"}</code>, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                then , i made a set called usedNames  , set because it doesn't allow duplicate entries and well having two or more regions with the same name can be confusing
            </p>
            <p>
                now the code doesn't know the limits it can make the region in yet , so i defined a max size which takes the min of the number of rows and cols and divides it by 2 , so that no region has a huge starting advantage of area
            </p>
